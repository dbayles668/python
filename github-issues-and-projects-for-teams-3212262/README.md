# GitHub Issues and Projects for Teams
This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course GitHub Issues and Projects for Teams. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning][lil-course-url].


With the plethora of issue-tracking tools out there, it can be challenging and confusing to plan and execute collaboration between and within teams. Github Issues, alongside Projects, can maximize autonomy and productivity within your organization, covering all points of a cross-functional team, including engineering, product, and design on one platform. In this course, instructor Teresa Luz Miller helps you help your team members learn how to effectively communicate with each other on the same platform to ensure productivity and collaboration is set across all levels of a team. Teresa guides you through the basics of creating an issue, using task lists, adding assignees, and linking pull requests. She shows you how to manage labels and milestones and use templates. Teresa goes over ways to manage issues, create a project, attach and remove existing issues, manage iterations, and more. Plus, she explains best practices for teamwork planning, as well as managing issues and projects.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:
